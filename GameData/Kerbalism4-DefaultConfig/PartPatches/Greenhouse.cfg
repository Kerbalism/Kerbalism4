    // Photosynthesis reaction: 2xH2O + CO2 -> O2 + CH2O + H2O
    // Note that CH2O is an intermediate carbohydrate, energy that goes into the
    // food, in the actual food it can be any CxHyOz compound

    // In a hydroponic system plants grow in water containing nutrients, the
    // system is assumed to be closed loop.
    // Water efficient foods require around 250-500 L water per kg of crop, see
    // https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/10/how-much-water-food-production-waste
    // In a regenerative system (see https://www.ag.arizona.edu/lunargreenhouse/Documents/2012-07-20_01_Giacomelli.pdf
    // slide 19) water is also produced.
    // 1 unit of Food has a mass 0.28 kg (see community resource pack),
    // therefore we will use 1.8 L/kg * 0.28 kg = 0.5 L of Water
    // 1 unit of Water matches 1 L, so we need 0.5 units of Water per unit of Food.
