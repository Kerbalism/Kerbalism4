  // You can define a HVL (Half Value Layer) value in meters for specific resources.
  // - lowHVL is the thickness of that material required to block half of incoming 1 MeV gamma radiation.
  //   Will be used for local sources (rtg, nuclear reactor...) and for "ambiant" radiation (planets, belts...)
  // - highHVL is the thickness of that material required to block half of incoming 25 MeV gamma radiation.
  //   That value will be used for solar storm radiation
  // Note that the resource amount is scaled by the part volume to determine the resource thickness on each part.
  // ksmShielding values are based on some literature about PET polymers (density 1.38) considered for IRL radiation shielding.
